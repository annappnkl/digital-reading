# Interactive AI Reading Tool for Comprehension Support

This project explores how AI can enhance long-form reading comprehension through interactive text simplification. Readers click on individual words to receive simpler synonyms or explanations, reducing cognitive load and improving understanding. Built with Next.js and OpenAI's API, the prototype supports word-level interaction logging, synonym replacement, partial sentence rewriting, and image generation from selected passages. Part of a broader research study using NASA-TLX, PRLSQ, and comprehension assessments to evaluate cognitive and motivational effects.
